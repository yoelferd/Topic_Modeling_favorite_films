# Topic Modeling: favorite films

Think about your top 50 favorite movies.

Do they have anything in common?
Do you only like action-thrillers where the main character gets into a lot of fights?
Do you mostly like to watch romcoms where the main character falls in love with and breaks up with, and gets back together with, the same person over and over again?

In this notebook I use natural language processing (NLP), specifically Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA) to model the topics covered in the plot descriptions of my favorite movies.
I use BeautifulSoup to scrape the Wikipedia plots for a list of movies and extract the most prevalent topics to see if I can uncover a pattern in my movie taste.
